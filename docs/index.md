## graphotate

graphotate is a [spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) where the user can combine stators and rotors, then select points on the rotors to draw colored lines by letting the rotors rotate along the stators. 

The resulting image consists of roulette curves called hypotrochoids (rotator runs inside stator) or epitrochoids (rotator runs along the outside of the stator). In graphotate the image can be saved, reset or drawn over.
